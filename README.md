# E-CNN-classifier
This is the avaiable code for the paper `An evidential classifier based on Dempster-Shafer theory and deep learning' (arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.13549).

Codes for Dempster-Shafer layer and utility layer in the file "libs", as well as the metrics "average utility".

The file demo.ipynb provides a demo how to build, train, and interfere precise and imprecise classification the evidential CNN classifier with the Dempster-Shafer layer and utility layers.

The file "weights_zoo" includes the parameters of a trained evidential CNN classifier and can be used in the demo.

The required libraries and their version:

python == 3.7.10

tensorflow == 2.4.1.
